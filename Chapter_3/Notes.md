# Functions

## Developer defined functions

**Preconditions** are the conditions that the function assumes are in place and it will not function if that is not the case
**Postconditions** are the conditions that are assumed to exist after the function it self is ran.
All functions should be considered to be black boxes and therefore not trusted. You have to check values going in and out so that they are correct and if they are not then pre or post conditions need to be checked.
